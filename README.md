    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
4.  **Install the required Python packages:**
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
5.  **Set up your environment variables:**
    -   Rename the `backend/.env.example` file to `backend/.env`.
    -   Open the `backend/.env` file and add your Google Gemini API key:
        ```
        GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_SECRET_API_KEY"
        ```

## Usage

1.  **Start the Flask server:**
    ```
    python backend/app.py
    ```
2.  Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5001`.
3.  Select a function from the dropdown menu.
4.  Type your message and click "Send".

## Deployment

This application is configured for easy deployment on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). After pushing the code to your GitHub repository, you can import the project on the Vercel dashboard.

The `vercel.json` file in the root directory handles the build and routing configuration, telling Vercel how to serve the static frontend and run the Python backend as a serverless function[1, 2].
